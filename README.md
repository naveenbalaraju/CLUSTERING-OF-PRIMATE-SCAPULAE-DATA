# CLUSTERING-OF-PRIMATE-SCAPULAE-DATA
Motivation of this project is clustering of Primate Scapulae dataset that contains the physiological measurement of the scapula bone from 5 different genera of primates.

1. Gibbons (Hylobates) 
2. Orangutans (Pongo) 
3. Chimpanzees (Pan) 
4. Gorillas(gorilla) 
5. Man (Homo) 

 I've have implemented Hierarchical clustering with single,complete,average linkage and K-means clustering.
 Used Analytical methods like Silhouette plot and Kmedoids to find the number of the clusters in tha data.
