# CLUSTERING-OF-PRIMATE-SCAPULAE-DATA
Primate. Scapulae is a Dataset that contains the physiological measurement of the scapula bone from 5 different genera of primates.

1. Gibbons (Hylobates) 
2. Orangutans (Pongo) 
3. Chimpanzees (Pan) 
4. Gorillas(gorilla) 
5. Man (Homo) 


The data set consists of 11 variables and 105 observations. The variables "AD.BD","AD.CD","EA.CD" "Dx.CD", "SH.ACR" are the 5 different indices of the scapulae bones. The variable "EAD", "beta", "gamma" are the angles related to bone. Since, gamma angle is is missing for Homo, the gamma variable is deleted for the further analysis.
